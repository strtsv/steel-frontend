                Steel and Fabrication Industry was incorporated in April of 1989
                with the objective of offering the market a higher level of
                excellence in steel fabrication. Its organizers, with a combined
                sixty years of experience in steel fabrication, machining,
                manufacturing, and design could see that many large
                manufacturers were scaling back their own companyâ€™s to reduce
                costs. To achieve their objectives Steel and Fabrication
                Industry assembled a team of experienced and certified
                craftsmen, engineers, and designers with a commitment to quality
                and efficiency.
